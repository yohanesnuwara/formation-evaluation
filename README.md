This library has modules and functions that perform support additional functionalities that might be useful in petrophysics and formation evaluation, such as:

* Triple combo visualization of GR-resistivity-NPHI-RHOB
* Well-log curves with color fills
* Neutron-density plot with sand, limestone, and dolomite line
* Creating formation labels from well markers or top data
* Merge two data by interpolation, e.g. creating TVD on MD-based well-log data from trajectory file
* Re-gridding well-log data to produce blocky log (depth-averaging intervals)
* Fracture data analysis (stereonet, rose diagram)
